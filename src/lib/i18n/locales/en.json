		"description": "OpenCMM is an image-based CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) that works inside a CNC machine.",
		"why": {
			"title": "Why inside a CNC machine?",
			"reason": "Although a general CMM is very accurate, it is necessary to take out the product to measure it. For this reason, if the result of the measurement does not meet the requirements, you have to do centering again, which offten takes time. Also, centering is not always accurate, which leads to inaccurate processing.",
			"advantage": "By measuring inside the CNC machine, there is no need for centering after measurement, and the product stays in the same position before and after measurement. This allows for more accurate processing and less time spent on centering."
		},
		"how": {
			"title": "How does it work?",
			"step1": "Load the 3D model of the part to be measured into the software.",
			"step2": "Download the G-code file for the CNC machine.",
			"step3": "Run the G-code file and start measuring.",
			"step4": "See the results in the software."

		"goal": {
			"title": "Our goal",
			"description": "The goal of this project is to build a CMM that can measure with an accuracy of ~1Âµm."
		},
		"progress": {
			"title": "Progress",
			"current": "We tested with our prototype and achieved an accuracy of ~0.1mm. We connected the camera and the CNC machine with tape, but we will build the metal connector between the camera and the CNC machine soon."
