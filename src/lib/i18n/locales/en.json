			"title": "Why inside a CNC machine?",
			"reason": "Although conventional CMMs are accurate, you have to take out from the CNC machine for measurement. On-machine measurement can combine the two processes of machining and measurement into one process."

		"how": {
			"title": "How does it work?",
			"step1": "Load the 3D model of the part to be measured into the software.",
			"step2": "Download the G-code file for the CNC machine.",
			"step3": "Run the G-code file and start measuring.",
			"step4": "See the results in the software."
