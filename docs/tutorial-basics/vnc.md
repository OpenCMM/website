# VNC
You can access CNC machine from your computer using VNC.

## What is VNC?
VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.  

Some CNC machines have already installed VNC software. If your CNC machine does not have VNC software, you can install it yourself.
