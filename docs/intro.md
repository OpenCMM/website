# Tutorial Intro

**OpenCMM** is an on-machine CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine).

## Why inside a CNC machine?

Although conventional CMMs are accurate, you have to take out from the CNC machine for measurement. On-machine measurement can combine the two processes of machining and measurement into one process.

## How does it work?

1. Load the 3D model of the part to be measured into the software
2. Download the G-code file for the CNC machine
3. Run the G-code file and start measuring
4. See the results in the software

## Our goal

The goal of this project is to build a CMM that can measure with an accuracy of **10Âµm**.
